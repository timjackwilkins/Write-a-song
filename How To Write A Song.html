    The shower is a good place for this.
Your phone recorder is your best friend.<br> Write down or record any and all ideas that you like. Remember that the song already exists, its just your job to let it come out.

        <br> 
        <div class="description" style="color: #795636; font-weight: 600;"> Seek a chorus within the melody or the chords. Look for the <b>you-est</b> elements in your vocal gibberish. The more uncomfortable it makes you to express it, the better. People connect with each others rough edges. Songs give you and outlet to show yours.

        Not all songs follow this structure of songwriting, but many do, and its a great place to start.

Not only are you memorizing the song, but your brain is melding with it, and new ideas naturally start to spring from this process. This is the good shit. Its like falling in love.

You have written your first song. You can take it with you wherever you go, sing it to whomever you want, WOO that girl or boy you been try to WOO, and just in general be a badass songwriter.

           Writing a song is like dating. Most dates aren't life changing, soul shifting, god sent occurrences. Most dates are pretty average, and some just plain suck. But every now and then, you fall in love, and its totally euphoric, and for the rest of your life that person becomes a part of your story.

Songs are like just that. 

When you write a good song, and your heart comes shining through, and you find the words to bring to life that secret sky within, that's the glorious moment when you realize that your just a another vessel, frantically scribbling down the thoughts of god.
